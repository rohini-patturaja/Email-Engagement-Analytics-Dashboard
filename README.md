# 📧 Email Engagement Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **email campaign engagement** data to understand how alumni and stakeholders interact with university communications. The goal is to uncover actionable insights related to **opens, clicks, delivery performance, and engagement timing**, and present them through an **interactive Tableau dashboard**.

The dashboard is designed with a **business storytelling approach**, enabling marketing and advancement teams to optimize email strategy based on data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

* Measure and compare engagement performance across email campaigns
* Identify high-performing campaigns based on open and click behavior
* Understand **when** users are most likely to engage (day, hour, month)
* Analyze delivery effectiveness and bounce behavior
* Enable dynamic exploration using parameters (Top N, Metric Selection, Time Filters)

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains email-level engagement data with the following fields:

* **Email Address**
* **Email Name (Campaign)**
* **Email Type**
* **Delivery Status** (Delivered, Bounced, Blocked, etc.)
* **Opened** (Binary)
* **Clicked** (Binary)
* **First Opened UTC**
* **Last Opened UTC**
* **First Clicked UTC**
* **Last Clicked UTC**
* **Marked as Spam**
* **Unsubscribe**
* **Group Unsubscribe**

⚠️ Note: The dataset does not contain a sent timestamp or revenue metrics. All time-based analyses are derived from engagement events.


Blocked: Blocks occur when your IP address has been blacklisted, blocked by an ISP or messaging organization, or if the message content is flagged by a filter on the recipient’s server. Blocks are less severe than bounces and do not result in permanent suppressions, meaning subsequent sends to blocked email addresses will be attempted. If an email address continues to be blocked after two subsequent send attempts, only then will the address be suppressed or "hard bounced."
Bounced: A bounce means the receiving server could not or would not accept the message. Bounced emails can mean either a permanent failure to deliver the email (hard bounce) or a temporary failure to deliver the email (soft bounce), based on conditions with the recipient mail server.
Soft Bounce: If the recipient’s inbox was full, the server was down, the message was too large for the recipient’s inbox, or even the recipient email server has been sent too many emails during a period of time, the sent email may result in a "soft bounce." This means that the email is initially reported as undeliverable but will continue to be attempted for up to 72 hours of being sent. There may be instances where the email will display both Bounced and Delivered if the email soft bounced initially but was later successfully delivered. If an email address (soft) bounces for 3 email sends without delivering, subsequent sends will result in a hard bounce from the email address.
Hard Bounce: If an email address is invalid, the recipient has previously unsubscribed from your emails, or there were 3 previous soft bounces, this will result in a “hard bounce” and be permanently suppressed in future email sends. The Data Health Tool will pull in all emails that have bounced more than three times and mark them as an “Undeliverable Email Address”. You can then use this tool to modify or delete the email addresses.
Cancelled: An email that was scheduled to be sent was cancelled by the sender.
Deferred: The recipient mail server asked Virtuous CRM+ to stop sending emails so fast. Similar to a soft bounce, a Deferred email will attempt to send again within the 72 hour period.
Delivered: The accepted response generated by the recipients' mail server.
Dropped: An email will be dropped when the recipient of that email is unsubscribed, the recipient email previously (hard) bounced, or that recipient has marked your email as spam.
Expired: Expired means that an email has soft bounced, but it is a specific type of bounce. If an email bounces, we will retry for up to 72 hours. If the email is unable to be delivered within the 72 hour window, it will expire and be marked as Bounced - Expired.
Failed: Your email data could not be sent to our email server. If this occurs, contact Virtuous Support for additional troubleshooting and recommendations.
Processed: Your email data has been successfully sent to our email server and is ready to be sent.
Processing: Your email data is currently being sent to our email server to be sent. The timeframe for an email send to process depends on the size of your email. Once finished, the status will update automatically to Processed and then, Delivered.

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Cleaning

Data preprocessing was performed using **Python (pandas)** and includes:

* Standardizing email addresses (lowercase, trimmed)
* Removing fully duplicate records
* Handling missing timestamps (NaT values)
* Normalizing categorical fields (Email Type, Delivery Status)
* Creating safe binary aggregations for Opened and Clicked metrics

---

## 📐 Key KPIs Calculated

* **Emails Sent**
* **Emails Delivered**
* **Open Count & Open Rate**
* **Click Count & Click-Through Rate (CTR)**
* **Open-to-Click Rate (CTOR)**
* **Bounce Rate**
* **Unsubscribe Rate**
* **Spam Rate**
* **Unique Opens & Unique Clicks**
* **Campaign Rank (by volume and engagement)**

---

## 📈 Dashboard Components (Tableau)

### 1️⃣ KPI Summary Cards

* Emails Sent
* Emails Delivered
* Emails Opened
* Unique Clicks
  Includes month-over-month comparison indicators.

---

### 2️⃣ Performance by Campaign Table

An interactive table displaying:

* Campaign Name
* Sent Rank (visualized using circular badges)
* Delivered & Opened (bar indicators)
* Open Rate, Click Rate, Open-to-Click Rate (donut-style visuals)
* Dynamic **Top N** and **Sort By** controls

---

### 3️⃣ Calendar Heatmap (Engagement Activity)

* Shows engagement intensity by **day of month**
* Driven by **First Opened UTC**
* Supports dynamic metric selection (Sent, Opened, Clicked, Bounced)

---

### 4️⃣ Weekday & Hour Analysis

* Bar charts highlighting engagement by:

  * Day of week
  * Hour of day
* Helps identify optimal email timing

---

### 5️⃣ Open Rate vs Click Rate Scatter Plot

* Each point represents a campaign
* Used to identify:

  * High open but low click campaigns
  * Highly engaged campaigns
  * Optimization opportunities

---

## 🎛 Parameters & Interactivity

* **Year Selector**
* **Month Selector**
* **Metric Selector** (Sent, Opened, Clicked, Bounced)
* **Top N Campaigns**
* **Sort Table By Metric**

All parameters are fully interactive and dashboard-driven.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Certain campaigns achieve high open rates but underperform on clicks, indicating content optimization opportunities.
* Engagement varies significantly by weekday, with mid-week showing higher activity.
* Campaign ranking changes depending on whether volume or engagement metrics are used.
* Open-to-click rate reveals which campaigns truly convert attention into action.
